# [WIP] UnitfulEquivalences

This package extends the [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl)
package to enable conversion between quantities of different dimensions, related by an
equivalence (e.g., the mass–energy equivalence *E* = *mc*²).

This package is **work in progress** and not yet registered.
